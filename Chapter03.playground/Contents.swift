//Ternary Operator
/*
 The ternary operator is very similar to an if/else statement, but it has the more concise syntax
 a ? b : c. In English, the ternary operator reads something like,
 â€œIf a is true, then do b. Otherwise, do c."
 */

//Instead use the if
message = population < 10000 ?
"\(population) is a small town!" :
"\(population) is pretty big!"
