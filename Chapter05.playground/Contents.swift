/*
If/else statements execute code based on whether the condition under consideration evaluates to
 true. switch statements consider a particular value and attempt to match it against a number of
 expressions, called cases. If there is a match, the switch executes the code associated with
 that case. In this chapter, you will explore the use of switch statements for evaluating an
 expression against multiple possible matching values.

/*
Switch Vs If/else

 switch statements are primarily useful for comparing a value against a number of potentially
 matching cases. if/else statements, on the other hand, are best for checking against a single
 condition. switch also offers a number of powerful features that allow you to match against
 ranges, bind values to local constants or variables, and match patterns in tuples â€“ to name
 just a few features covered in this chapter.
